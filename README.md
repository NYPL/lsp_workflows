# lsp_workflows
A documentation repo for multi-component workflows

# Goals and Expectations

This is a documentation repository for LSP workflows. A workflow is a standard sequence of interactions that cuts across multiple LSP components. The goal of this repository is to make it easy to understand the expected behavior of components during multi-component flows.

This repository has a workflow page for each workflow, as well as an index page linking workflows to their components.

 The ideal workflow page:

* SHOULD cover every case that can occur in the workflow
* SHOULD show some Input and Output for each component in each case
* SHOULD have a link to a diagram of the workflow, where appropriate
* SHOULD describe how to test the workflow
* SHOULD describe external services used and how we expect to interact with them
* SHOULD have links to corresponding component READMEs in the index page (described below)

We also have an index page, which lists all the workflows with links to the READMEs of their components
